													Tidy data set characteristics
												====================================

Base - the big consolidated dataset
===================================
The consolidated data collated and merged from the above listed files, make a big dataset of 10299 records, with 563 columns.

Test data records  count 							= 2947
Train data records count 							= 7352
Various measurements  observed/produced 			= 561
Total columns in the big data set 					= 563
Additional columns added to the dataset
	- SUBJECT  - indicating the people who performed the activities
	- Activity - different activities performed by the subject.

Tidy dataset the final dataset
==============================
	Columns
		The big dataset is grouped by subject and activities, considering only the mean() and std() measurements , with subject and activity added as additional columns. 68 columns in total.
	Rows
		30 different subjects and 6  different activities accounting for 180 rows.

Tidydata.txt - has 180 rows of 68 columns.

List of Columns [68 columns]
============================

				subject      				-	SUBJECT who performed the activity
				activity					- 	Various activities performed
				
For the below columns please refer the features.txt and features_info.txt to get some background. In the tidy dataset, they are grouped by the subject who performed an activity and the performed activity.
